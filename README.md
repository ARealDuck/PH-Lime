A custom made arcade style controller board for the Beatmania IIDX series in double play mode as well as the firmware to support it.

can also be used for Beatmania IIDX SP (single play) mode, the Sound Voltex series games, and even pop'n series games as well. Granted you need supporting firmware for titles outside of Beatmania IIDX titles

I plan on making a wiki detailing everything as well as documentation on how to make your own firmware/modifying current firmware once I get a prototype working.

please do not commercially sell anything or redistribute anything here without my permission first thank you.
